This all-Spanish handbook for parents with new babies will prove essential for any concerned about a child's health. Manual Pediatrico appeared first in English; the Spanish edition provides essential health information at a glance for parents unversed in medical care; and should be a mainstay of  any Spanish-speaking home with children

McCarthy's writing and portrayal of Lester Ballard, a necrophiliac, is so well done that when the townfolk are after him you want him to escape. And then you have to wonder...why am I siding with a necrophiliac of all people? The writing is up to the high standards expected of McCarthy, and as usual he plumbs darker side of the human psyche. The book has an interesting twist to the plot - Ballard is falsely accused of rape, his house is auctioned off and he's left as a social outcast, an animal. He is removed of all his ties to humanity and so becomes the animal. If you like books that deal with the darker side of life then give this a read

Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.

I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.

The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time

I was initiated into the world of Cormac McCarthy with this novel in Southern Lit class.  My professor was the vice president of the Cormac McCarthy Appreciation Society and considers McCarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century, as do I.  This work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of Faulkner.  It incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter, but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point.  There is a message about decay, especially of the south in the diction, especially where the flood and the degeneration of Lester Ballard are concerned.  There is Old South v. New South and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of Ballard.  There is also lust here, something that Faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than McCarthy in the Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying.  However, McCarthy's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor.  McCarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution, as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about.  The ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator, performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well, is the most unique of gifts.  This novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the read.  It is haunting to the reader, not for its perverse subject matter, but for its understated messages, masterfully placed in the character of Lester Ballard, a disposessed and depraved madman, holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to

I cannot speak to the literary points in the novel though I can say I enjoyed it. In fact, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. However, I think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee! Strangely, the author refers accurately to several persons and events that I've known forever. Mr. Wade's children still live in Sevierville, so do the Whaley and Ogle families. The 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the White Caps were stopped by a real life Clint Eastwood of a Sevier County Sheriff! The opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than C.B. McCarter whose trademark saying was &quot;WE SELL THE EARTH.&quot; C.B., my grandfather, has never told me of any run-ins with Lester Ballard, the novels main character! THANK GOODNESS! As it turns out Ballard is a murdering necrophiliac. This is where McCarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community

There is no denying the strain of Faulkner that runs through McCarthy's early works; like his predecessor, McCarthy is concerned less with plot than with character and the many and sundry ways in which character and place (here, the hills of Eastern Tennessee) interact.  But McCarthy is more fun to read; his prose is lean and lyric and leaves lasting images in the mind's eye.  He does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly (often ungodly) forms.  &quot;Child of God&quot; is best-known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia--few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful, elegant prose.  But that is one of the great joys of Cormac McCarthy's early novels--they are not so much tours de force as they are exhibitions of  beautifully painted landscape and haunting, nightmarish imagery

I have read sevral of McCarthy's other novels. His best ones stretch something to the limit.  In &lt;Blood Meridian&gt; it was violence.  Here it is simple depravity and lack of concern for other human beings.  Lester Ballard is the ultimate user.  Other people exist for him only to meet his needs, even if they are dead.  I have never before read a book about necrophilia, and yes, as many of the other reviewers point out, reading this book takes a strong stomach.  Yet McCarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off, which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic.  Totally in spite of myself, I found myself cheering Ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away.  The only thing I can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester.  Yet, I believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book.  I don't think the title is meant to be ironic.  I think we are meant to see that even Lester Ballard really is a child of God

This is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world. Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs

If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book

What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association.  It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like &quot;is the kennel business for me?&quot; and &quot;what are the main issues in kennel management?&quot;  Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US.  For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag

"Ha ha ha hah ha hah!"  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this "Tolkein as faith" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the "thanks for the buck buddy" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense!

My recommendation?  Read the book.  Laugh a bit.  Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for

The Protector's War (2005) is the second Alternate History novel in the Change series, following Dies the Fire.  In the previous volume, the Bearkillers allied with the Mackenzie Clan, CORA -- Central Oregon Ranchers' Association -- and the University Committee.  They cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along Highway 20 at the Echo Creek bridge, using Larson's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction.  Then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang-gliders.

In this novel, during the eighth year after the Change, Alleyne Loring and John Hordle break into Woburn Abbey to free Nigel and Maude Loring.  The Special Icelander Detachment guards are bypassed, distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the Lorings.  Nigel and Maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons.

When the blocked door is noticed, Nigel and Maude respond with knife and club as the SID guards attempt to force the door.  They gain some time, but eventually the guards get into the room.  Nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers.  When Hordle enters the room, the guards retreat down the hallway.

Nigel has minor wounds, but Maude has been cut through the abdomen.  She bleeds out as her husband holds her.  At the urgings of the rescuers, Nigel lays Maude's body on the sofa and flees out the window.  The SID guards don't pursue them, but other troops are searching the countryside.

At Larsdalen, on the ninth anniversary of the Change, Mike Havel -- Lord Bear -- concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder;  as it burns instead of flaring, the audience cheers, moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the Change. The party (or wake) continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the A-list.

Lord Ken, Mike's father-in-law, shows his latest attempts to understand the Change.  The Ideal Gas Law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value;  the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure.  Still, reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the Change.  It looks like the Alien Space Bat theory is correct;  someone or something has imposed the Change upon them.

In McMinnville, the Protector is building another fort.  This one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel I-beams and concrete.  Still, the Protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack.

This story is, despite the name, the prelude to the Protector's War.  Both sides are preparing for the war, but not eager to start it right away.  The Protectorate is stronger, but the alliance is growing faster.  Of course, the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy:  self-centered concerns, diverse opinions, and sheer indecisiveness.  All this hampers their preparations, but few really doubt that the Protectorate will try to conquer the Williamette Valley and beyond.

BTW, do you reckon that the date of the Change -- March 17th -- is symbolic?  It is Saint Patrick's Day and Juney's mother was Irish, but what could it mean?

Highly recommended for Stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue, military training and actions, and perseverance.

I loved Stirling's "Islands in the Sea of Time" trilogy, and I also loved the first book in this series.  Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I've ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL.  It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters.  This book is a major disappointment.  Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters.  It comes across as simply ludicrous.  The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters.  This is a very poor effort and though I plan to read book three even though I hated book two, I think a person, by reading the reviews of book two on Amazon, could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing

It completely sucked. Very long with nothing to say. Author was proud of his own knowledge of the SCA and Wiccans, and the publishers thought that obviated the need for plot or character development. What's the worst is that the extra length is just packed full of both cliched lines and characters.

I now live overseas, so I bought a bunch of books in the "4 for 3" price discount section in order to save money. This is the first one I read of the received books. If they're all this bad, I'll be avoiding that discount database in the future

I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like "what just happened!". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.

Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.

There seem to be no faults in the utopian "good guys" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.

Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.

The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional "Clans". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.

But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:

What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story.

That is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer.

I love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented. No offense to anyone that loves it

Yet another fine effort from Stirling.  The finely developed plot, the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible, and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again.  A proven master of the genre, his characters continue to be excellent -- deep and detailed.  The plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks, but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels.
I found the title a bit misleading, however, given the way the plot develops.  No spoilers, so I won't elaborate other than to suggest "Gathers the Storm" or somthing similar might have ben a better title.  Hopefully "A Meeting at Corvallis" will be equally entertaining

Mr. Stirling has succeded again.  Protector's War is an amazing addition to the Change Trilogy, and well worth the read.  Honestly, I don't know where to start when explaining how good it is, so I will let you know the one thing I found highly disappointing about it, in one word:
Wicca.
That's right, Mr. Sterling has filled this book with so much "blessed be's" and "Lord and Lady" junk that you have to actually wade around that gobbledeegook to get to the real story.  In fact, if it weren't for the obviously well writt and enjoyable story underneath all that dross, I'd have given this book two, maybe three stars.  Somehow I highly doubt that wicca would ever, ever evolve to become a major religion after such a massive cataclysim such as Mr. Sterling protrays here.  Likely the major religious parties of each continent would rise up again, i.e. Christianity/Catholicism in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, Anamism/Islam in Africa, Islam/Buddhism/Hinduism/Shintoism/Anamism in Asia, etc.  But Mr. Sterling not only is portraying a world where wicca is widely practiced, but one where the "Lord and Lady" actually interact with some of the characters.  Yet the characters don't sit there and think to themselves, "Hey, my gods never claim to be all nice and merciful, and they actually exist, maybe they are responsible for what happened?!"  Nope, never crosses the Mackenzies mind.  Oh, well.  My only advise to Mr. Stirling would be, keep up the great stories, but keep the preaching about wicca to a minimum.  We don't mind religions being portrayed in a positive light, and I'm personally pleased at the relative equal positive descriptions of the surviving religions, but let's try to keep to a minimum the "blessed be's" or "lord and lady" references to a religion a lot of your readers may find, well, offensive, kay

While I enjoyed most of Dies the Fire, by the end I was very annoyed with the Juniper character, and found myself skipping over the (boring) details of her wiccan prayers and outlook. I had hopes for The Protectors War, and unfortunately it's worse than it's predecessor. McKenzie and her group get far too much play, and come across as self righteous religious fanatics. The reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems, as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle. I found myself skipping large chunks of this book, and the editing- switching from linear narrative to flashback in midstream- didn't help matters any. There is too much exposition, and not enough action. All in all, a boring disapointment. The third book in the series is out in hardcover, but I won't even be checking it out of the library.

Many reviewers have commented that Taylor's "American Colonies" gives indigenous peoples a larger role in North American history than most previous studies do.  This perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the American Revolution.

Among the Revolution's motives were "liberty" (a better form of government than that provided by London) and "empire" (eliminating British barriers to the colonies' territorial expansion).  Since the indigenous people were the ones most affected by the colonists' territorial expansion, giving them a larger role in the history, as Taylor does, makes the history read more in the "imperial" vein.  See chapter 18, "Imperial Wars and Crisis: 1739-75."

In an important way, the "liberty" and "empire" motives both came down to land.  The colonists knew that a key reason they were freer than the average Briton was that they could move into land acquired from the indigenous peoples.  Jefferson summed up their objective as "an empire of liberty," which Taylor uses as chapter 18's final section heading

The reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book. It makes for hard going, however, the insights into the true American history are many. The threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools. Yet the main disappointment, other than the fact many have complained about (ie: the death of Kamehameha), is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book, which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway, Roxie Yonkey, also noted. This is one of those times when I wish to debate the wherefores with my dear friend

Has a pretentiousness to it that is sometimes nauseating but for the most part is a very informative well-written text by a good historian. That is, unless your car won't start before the final and he decides to give you an insanely difficult alternative the following Monday two days before Christmas.  In that scenario, his good-historian-ness flies out the window and you just hate his guts. Taylor: Not all of us come from big money! Sorry my 80s model car exploded and inconvenienced you so! Thanks for ruining my gpa!
Good book though

We all learned the basics of colonial history in school: the Mayflower; Jamestown; Tobacco; the development of New Amsterdam, Boston, Charleston, & Philadelphia; indentured servants; and French trappers / Spanish Conquistadores.  However, most history books and classes spare the details about how the colonies truly developped between 1492 and about 1760.  Moreover many histories contain stunning inaccuracies about colonists and Indians.

Despite being an American History buff, it was not until finishing this excellent survey of the colonial period that I realized how little I knew.  Taylor has put together a detailed but approachable narrative of the Spanish, French, English, Swedish, Dutch, German, etc colonizers who shaped what was to become the United States.  There are plenty of fascinating details about exploration, the hardships of the first settlements and the problems faced by the expanding colonies.  More importantly, this book provides a solid background for why the English-speaking colonies prevailed and the baggage they carried entering the revolutionary period.

A well-written and well-researched book about an important era in our history that far too little is written about.  This is history that is hard to put down

Traditionally, coverage of "colonial America" is confined to the study of the thirteen English colonies of the eastern seaboard - a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of European involvement in North America, to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before Christopher Columbus's historic voyage.  Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants.

His scope is impressive.  After an initial chapter that provides a 14,500 year overview of the population migration that settled the continent, Taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the European colonies in the region.  The canvas is immense, encompassing the Spanish settlements of the Southwest, the exploration of Canada, and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the West Indies, as well as the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by nearly a half-dozen European countries.  Through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population, as well as the trans-Atlantic relations with Europe and Africa.

Taylor's macro-historical approach does not exclude the details of settlement, though.  Throughout the book, the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions, detailing the choices they made, the factors that went into them, and how these choices shaped subsequent development.  The result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together (though not necessarily within these pages) into the United States of today.

As the first book in the "Penguin History of the United States," Taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes.  By blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a well-written account, he has produced a superb history of America's colonial development, one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come

Books like this are regrettably--but understandably--rare. Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done

Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States.

A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book.

Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves.

I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans.

The story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy.

I liked very much how softly the author gives us, the readers so much information on the lives of bees, and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested.

Although, I do not consider it a masterpiece it is very, very likable

You fall right in love with the charicters.  This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love.  It is such a dynamic story with suspense.  I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone

This book really great. I enjoyed the story immensley. Character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized. I really could picture myself at the "flamingo pink" house in Tiburon. The main character, Lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across, but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother. The group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life, love, faith and understanding. It's very heartfelt

One of the best books ever!!!!  I was disappointed that the story wasn't longer, as I was so sorry when it was over.  I even contemplated rereading it immediately, but decided to try another Sue Monk Kidd novel instead, and read The Mermaid Chair.  Different genre, but also very entertaining!  I have become an overnight, true fan of this author

Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.

When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).

On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.

Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.

While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.

A very good read

The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era.  It was wonderfully told and beautifully written.

Over the years I have read many books on the Red Scare in Hollywood and could never quite understand the attraction to communism.  This book does the best job of describing the issues, the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films.  In reading many past books, the authors never quite expressed WHY they were communists.  In fact, many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party.  This book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than Dalton Trumbo, one of the leading communists in Hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist.  And in the end, he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings.

But this book will not be without controversy as the authors are known as right-wing Republicans.  While I am in the middle of the political spectrum leaning slightly to the left, I find their account very believable and documented sufficiently to overcome any perceived bias.  The significance of this book to me from reading Ring Lardner's famous "I'd Hate Myself in the Morning" to watching Woody Allen's "The Front" and FINALLY getting a closing answer is overwhelming.  I no longer feel the need to explore why Americans chose to follow another government's agenda to the potential detriment of our country.  However, I do not fault these people for their initial attraction to communism and frankly, I don't view communism as wrong:  it's just a different government method some choose.  For myself, I remain quite satisfied with democracy, EVEN in these trying times.  Rather, the attraction to communism was clearly a byproduct of the recent depression as well as the growth of fascism.  I can live with that reasoning.

This is an exceptional book if you have any interest in the 50s, movies, or communism.  In closing, I must comment on the complete disrespect shown to Elia Kazen on receipt of his lifetime achievement award some years ago when Nick Nolte and others refused to applaud or acknowledge this award.  I suggest they read this book.  The Red Scare was a horrible period but Freedom of Speech needs only go so far when supporting a government with intent to overthrow our own.  I strongly recommend this book.

While George Clooney was simultaneously thumping his chest and patting his back for how he and his "community" are proudly out of touch with mainstream America, I was engaged in the rather more edifying exercise of reading this great new book by Ronald and Allis Radosh. For readers with an interest in the context of the culture-clash between the "Hollywood elite" and the poor benighted people who buy movie tickets and DVDs, this book is an excellent resource.

I say the "context" of the clash because this is a look at history, and a serious research work too. This is not a book that details the fashionable Leftist obsessions of Clooney, Streisand, Penn, and the rest, and therefore may be less satisfying to some readers than other recent books that address current names and controversies more directly. Instead, "Red Star Over Hollywood" digs deep into something far more serious and sinister ("sinister" comes from the Latin word for "left," by the way): the film colony's infiltration by agents of the Comintern, dedicated partisans of Stalin, and other actors, directors, writers, and executives eager to use the power of film to promote socialism in the United States.

As Clooney's speech -- and even more so, his movie -- make clear, modern Hollywood's sense of itself is built to a large degree on the legend of its heroic stand against "McCarthyism" and the blacklist (that's what makes Clooney's self-congratulation so laughable -- does anyone in Hollywood *defend* McCarthy?). But the Radoshes demonstrate not only that there really were communists in positions of influence (in other words, the witch-hunt turned up real witches), but that there was also a strong and active anti-communist Left in Hollywood. Even more than the relatively small number of conservatives in Hollywood, it was this anti-communist Left that was in the most direct conflict with the Stalinists, their apologists, and their dupes, particularly before and during World War II.

All of this is important information, but it's when they turn to their discussion of HUAC and the blacklist in the postwar period that the authors most directly confront Hollywood's defining myth. Far from the usual pop-psychology analysis of the deranged and sweaty McCarthy (and why do so few people seem to notice that *Senator* Joe McCarthy had nothing to do with the *House* Committee on Un-American Activities?) the authors have gone in-depth in committee records, and also into the backgrounds of the people from Hollywood who came before the committee. It's certainly easier to issue blanket denunciations of McCarthy and his ilk than to sift through pages and pages of dusty documents. Ronald and Allis Radosh are to be commended for doing the latter.

It's because this book is so heavily researched -- so filled with names, dates, and places -- that I note again that it may not be to everyone's taste. It is, I repeat, a work of history. It notably lacks the rhetorical sledgehammer blows of, say, an Ann Coulter book, and so doesn't have the fist-pumping, take-that-you-commie excitement value some readers derive from more polemical works. But those books seem to disappear as soon as they fall off the bestseller lists. This, on the other hand, is a book that deserves to be around for a long, long time

Remember the Hollywood blacklist? The Hollywood Ten? I'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you weren't alive in the 1950s. That's because Tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive. It was the era of the Red Scare, of Senator Joseph McCarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in West Virginia. It was the time of congressional investigations, a time when invoking the Fifth Amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye. For a select few the McCarthy era was a time of great fear, and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than Hollywood. Why? Because, despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years, the movie industry oozed communists. There were so many Reds in Hollywood that they should have renamed the town Little Moscow. Yet even today, you won't hear about this truth in the media. You will, however, get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of Ronald Radosh's "Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left."

Talk about exploding myths! Radosh's book, which he co-wrote with his wife Allis, cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real Hollywood of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Vladimir Lenin, the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of Marxism to the Soviet Union back in the early part of the twentieth century, had a soft spot for film and theater. He believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays. This is exactly what the Kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades. They managed to gain converts to their cause--men who later became movers and shakers like Budd Schulberg, Joseph Losey, and Maurice Rapf--by allowing them to work closely with the Soviet film industry. Once these people came back to the United States, they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg, V.J. Jerome, and John Howard Lawson. In no time at all, writes Radosh, a branch of the communist party flourished in Hollywood. So many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry, in an attempt to make contacts and find work, had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves.

The Hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways. One of the most successful methods involved the tried and true "United Frontism" and "Popular Front" techniques, or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes. Radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of National Socialist Germany in the 1930s helped increase membership, although the party's propensity to change direction, oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the Kremlin, tended to alienate many members. Also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time. Albert Maltz, for example, discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed "revisionist" by the upper hierarchy. His very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes. Despite the ugliness the Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed, they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like "Mission to Moscow," "The Spanish Earth," and "The North Star." Congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer, and silenced a few more, but many never repudiated their warped views.

I enjoyed Radosh's book, the first one of his I've had the chance to read. The author and his spouse obviously know what they're talking about and, since Ronald Radosh himself was a communist for many years, he understands how these groups think and act. "Red Star Over Hollywood" occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals, but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes. For instance, the part where we learn about Ronald Reagan (at the time a liberal) and his buddy William Holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about. Reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes. God bless him! The account of Albert Maltz's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling, a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism. Arguably the best part of the book, however, involves the long, strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life.  So many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat.

I have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book. In the case of the former, if you're not very familiar with this time period, read a background history of the Red Scare first. Doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist. In the case of the latter, the topic is so huge that Radosh doesn't have the space to cover many of the important Reds. There is almost nothing here about Lillian Hellman or Dashiell Hammett, for example, and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books. Nevertheless, this book is well worth your time. Read it and remember it the next time Hollywood releases yet another "we were innocent" propaganda piece.

I have always been curious about the influence of Communism in Hollywood.  This book by the Radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it.  It was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated.  It seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation.  I came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the Communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful.  The studio heads, whether for economic or patriotic reasons, insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions.    Like C Coffman who wrote the prior review, I wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the Soviet Union.  It was difficult for me to comprehend how the Hollywood writers continued to support the Soviet Union in the face of clear evidence that Soviet movie writers were being executed in the Soviet Union.  Nor could I fully understand how these Hollywood writers, men (mostly) of immense talent, cowered before their Communist censors.    Finally, the Radoshes put the "Hollywood Ten" and the blacklist years in perspective.  They state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the Congressional investigations were highly exaggerated.   I came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost.  It would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a Communist take over of the USA come true since like their fellow professionals in the Soviet Union they would have probably been executed.  Who said you can't win for losing!

This book touches on one of the touchiest and nerve-wracked controversies of the last sixty years. Precisely because of a tendency to close ranks around the defense of semi-myths one needs to zero in from two angles. Here we get the clear effort to indulge in what many would think revisionist propaganda. But despite an obvious bias built in to the account, the tale told is of interest from the conservative angle and sticks to the parts everyone should know, but might not, after the shouting matches over McCarthyism. I really think this book provokes the need for still another book to correct the correction, but in the meantime the information is interesting enough to be quite worth reading. Conservatives get fainting spells about commies in the movie business, but you can read around the lurid conservative passages (not so bad) for some useful corrections of the record, and no doubt much left out.

It's no secret that many of Hollywood's and the entertainment businesss's current "stars" are socialist afficienados (or worse), but where did this denationalized elitism come from? "Red Star Over Hollywood" does a spectacular job at laying out the groundwork and background of the Hollywood political left, Communists and fellow travelers from the 1930's to 1950's. With about 37 pages of reference material (diaries, speeches, Congressional testimony, biographies, autobiographies, news articles, interviews, etc.), the authors leave no doubt about how these folks cooperated with the Soviet Union in its attempts to "take over" Hollywood as a tool in their effort to create a Soviet America. The names of the actors, screen writers, producers etc who were card carrying Communists, fellow travelers, quislings, leftists, and varieties of socialists who made up the Hollywood scene in those days will floor you. You'll have to read the book to find out who they were.  And there were many heroes as well, who finally stood up and took on these cultural saboteurs. You'll never watch movies on the Turner Classic Movies channel the same way again. After you read the book, look closely at the writing and producing credits on these old films.

The authors draw some connections between the Hollywood leftists of that era and the current crop of leftists in the "entertainment industry" today. But that comes at the end of the book and is a very brief section.

This is a must read book for anyone who is even slightly interested in the Hollywood of the 30's-50's and who here's the sophist leftist pontifications of the Tim Robbins, Barbra Streisands, Bill Mahrs and others. One thing that will strike you  is how well educated, thoughful, well read and articulate both the left and the right were in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. There was intelligent discourse on all sides. They make today's left and right apologists seem like 3d graders reciting "Dick and Jane" from memory. That insight was worth the price of the book.

I used to wonder why Hollywood ignored the crimes of Soviet Communism, which easily rival the crimes of National Socialism, something they've shown us over and over and over again (certainly understandable). Not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during Lenin's "Red Terror," the deaths of millions during forced collectivization, the torture and mass murder during Stalin's purges of the late 30's, the cold-blooded massacre of thousands of Polish citizens at Katyn, or the horrors of the gulag. But Hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on "McCarthyism" and the ghastly "blacklist." They're listed in this book: Guilty by Suspicion, The Front, The Way We Were, The Majestic, Marathon Man, The House on Carroll Street, Fellow Traveler, One of Hollywood Ten. This is all propaganda of course. The way they tell it you'd think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history. McCarthy and his ilk were no saints, and there were certainly excesses, but I don't believe anyone was murdered by McCarthy and HUAC. By contrast tens of millions were murdered in Soviet Russia. Apparently that's no big deal to the fools in Tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over "McCarthyism," the blacklist and the persecuted Hollywood ten. These crybabies wouldn't have lasted ONE DAY in the Kolyma forced-labor camps!

The Radoshes show us that Hollywood back in the 30's and 40's was filled with Soviet-sympathizing Communists who put out propaganda films whitewashing Stalin's mass murders such as The North Star, Song of Russia and Mission to Moscow. While the first two simply glossed over the Stalinist holocaust in Ukraine, the latter film actually GLORIFIED Stalin's secret police and mass purges. Can you believe this? Hollywood actually justified Stalin's killing machine! Think about that the next time some Hollywood leftist whines about the "horrors" of "McCarthyism."

While no one in Hollywood would dare praise Stalin now, quite a few do embrace other blood-soaked Communist despots. For example, Shirley MacLaine made a pilgrimage to Red China, then reeling in the aftermath of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution, and declared that Mao Tse-tung was a hero of all time. Someone should let Shirley know that her "hero" is the biggest mass murderer in history (see "Mao: The Unknown Story" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday). And countless Hollywood "useful idiots" such as Robert Redford, Danny Glover, Oliver Stone and many, MANY others swoon over that thug Fidel Castro, who has more blood on his hands (15,000 killed) than the hated Augusto Pinochet (3,000 killed). Pinochet's crimes have been the subject of several Hollywood flicks - i.e. Missing, Of Love and Shadows, etc. None have been made on the mass murders of Castro and Mao. To add insult to injury Castroite Robert REDford was executive producer of "The Motorcycle Diaries," a saintly portrayal of Castro's chief executioner Ernesto "Che" Guevara in his early days. He later went on to murder hundreds of "counter-revolutionaries" at La Cabana prison, something that's highly unlikely to be portrayed in the next pro-Che film starring Benicio del Toro.

The negative reviews are beyond pathetic. McCarthy this... McCarthy that... blah, blah, blah... Of course they can't refute one thing in the book. They prefer myth, not facts. Hollywood was filled with Stalin-worshipping Reds (now Castro-worshipping Pinkos), the Rosenberg's were guilty as charged and Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy. Truth hurts - deal with it!

The McCarthy era is generally portrayed as one of the darkest times in American history, and those who faced blacklisting in Hollywood have been lauded as heroes. Through ground-breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials, the Radoshes have compiled a thorough re-examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the Communist Party, and their betrayal by that very same party.

The Radoshes describe the infatuation of "the Hollywood Party" from its roots in the 1930s, when several visited the Soviet Union.  They demonstrate that, far from being innocent, the "Hollywood Ten" were committed Communists, who used and abused free-speech supporters (like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) for their own ends. The Communist Party, in turn, cynically used the "Ten" for its own ends -- trotting them out to speak at unrelated left-wing events for years, which prevented the Ten from individually rehabilitating their images and obtaining work.  The authors also describe the way the CP line was inserted in several films, most notoriously, "Mission to Moscow." This film, designed to turn the views of a skeptical American public toward the USSR during World War II, whitewashes Stalin's purge trials of the 1930s, where many truly innocent were tortured into confessing and executed.  Perhaps most interesting is the difficult path faced by those who broke with the Party and either "named names" or walked a fine line to avoid naming names.  For many, being seen as an informer was worse than preventing and exposing genuine Communist infiltration.

If I have any criticisms of the book, it is that the Radoshes did not take their exploration of the film colony's long romance with the left through the Vietnam War years and today. While the blacklist years were seminal, many in Hollywood contine to lean left even after the fall of the USSR, and take almost reflexively anti-Bush positions today. We are left to wonder what the leftist fathers passed on to their sons. Perhaps the authors will address this issue in a subsequent book.  In the meantime, "Red Star Over Hollywood" is well worth reading.

The back lash continues against the media strangle-hold on revisionist history.

How many times have you watched a documentary or a movie that exhonerates those poor persecuted innocents, dubbed the Hollywood Ten, as sitting targets seated before an array of mean and ruthless right-wing zealots - the HUAC committee of the late 1940's and early 50's?  Over and over and over it seems, doesn't it?  Well now we have a detailed and painstakingly written rejoinder, "Red Star Over Hollywood", which tells the real tale; that these were mostly hard core members of the communist party USA, who took their marching orders directly from the Kremlin.  They were Stalin's men and, not to put to fine a point on it, useful idiots in his quest to foment a world-wide communist revolution.

Ron Radosh, a communist from childhood, smelled the coffee after he wrote a book trying to prove the innocence of the Rosenberg's only to find that .... they were guilty!  After he said so he was unceremoniously drummed out of the "leftist corp" and made to wear a political scarlet letter by his former comrades....some friends they.

Radosh is a PhD in History and a diligent, detailed researcher of the facts i.e. he's interested in the truth and in that sense wherever the facts lead him he will go.  Unfortunately, one doesn't find this trait to be prevalent among political ideaologues be they historians, archeologists, political scientists, reporters, book publishers or video media types.  As an aside, I found it interesting to compare this book with Neil gabler's, "An Empire of Their Own: How the Jew's Invented Hollywood."  The nexus for me is the juxtaposition of the capacity for those who would be relentlessly capitalistic to simultaneously have the ability to be in favor of a world-wide communistic revolution?  Is it a fear of chistianity as an ally of capitalism?  I don't know, but I for one would encourage Radosh to address the subject.  And, he's the man to do it (another book to read as a companion peace would be "Intellectuals" by Paul Johnson, the author of "Modern Times.")

It's important to recognize that not all of those in Hollywood, whose lives were ruined by HUAC, were hard-core communists.  Some were just idealistic liberals trying to make a differnce against perceived and real injustices.  To the readers benefit, Radosh teases out these nuances rather well, and anyone interested in this period of history will read this book with great interest.

Setting the record straight is important, but the Hollywood left still clings to a thin tissue when it characterizes this story as a "fable of innocence destroyed by malice."  It's their shakey attempt at moral authority, the kind that underpins a Sean Penn in his critique of Bush's Iraq policy, while he ignores the evils of Sadaam Hussein.

This book challenges the template of the Hollywood left: that these were brave dissenters standing up for the right to espouse unpopular beliefs against right-wing bullies leading a witch hunt against "un-American activities;" that they were victimized political innocents who were skewered by despicable sellouts who named names to save their careers.  Read it, it's good.

Once upon a time in the halls of academia, being a college graduate was enough. But now, corporations need their employees to have a more intense, ongoing academic and technical education, so they provide it themselves via corporate universities. Mark Allen and other experts from ten corporate universities, academic institutions and consultancies contributed chapters to The Corporate University Handbook, a practical, behind-the-scenes manual about designing and managing a corporate university. The goal goes beyond education: corporate universities must train employees and help corporations excel and prosper. This thorough, yet conversational, examination includes best practices, source notes and programs offered by specific companies including Motorola, Toyota, Sun Microsystems and Charles Schwab, in the U.S. and elsewhere. We from getAbstract assign this insightful book as an authoritative homework seminar for corporate university planners or managers

Because I don't get TV One and have only seen the show a few times, I was pleasantly suprised when I saw this cookbook today in the store. I recommend it a MILLION TIMES over instead of Mo'Nique's, especially since she got some of her recipes from him!!!

A GREAT way to get a taste of what's in store for you if you buy this book is to to go the show's website. Many recipes are there, but nothing beats having a book that you can carry with you. Some of these will be making their debut at the Thanksgiving table next week and I can't wait!

There are some beautiful photos but not a whole lot, but that doesn't take away from the book too much because you can view many of them on the site.

Highly recommended. I wanna have backbreaking sex with G. Garvin. Thanks for letting me share

My husband and I have been waiting for this book since we first saw G. Garvin on TVOne.  Needless to say, I am pleased with this book.  The layout and directions are clear and concise.  The entire book is not in color, but I can deal with that.  Here's the table of contents:
*Super Simple
*Family Style
*Market Fresh
*Good Food Made at Home
*Building a Great Dish
*Cognac, Sticks and Steaks
*Entertaining with G
*Sweet Thoughts
*Index

My one criticism is that I wish a hardback edition of this book was available

I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,

I've been adventuring off reading new writers that i've been hearing about. Well Sparks was one of them and after reading this I wonder why did it take me so long to read his books. This book was really heart touching. The mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his. The love story was also great because that is somewhat reality. When you loose someone or go threw hard times; Its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own . I can't wait to read more of Sparks books because I've already heard so many great things about them

I just got done reading The Rescue last night. I just didn't like the part when Taylor blamed himself for his father's death. He had a right to be happy and live his life. The boy really likes Taylor. Denise was a sweet lady. I am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a Dad. You might want to read that book again. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. I have been his fan for 1 year and a month. I love all his stories, I will be looking forard to the next one in October

I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.

I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked.

And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.

If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all.

I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah

The story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy.

I liked very much how softly the author gives us, the readers so much information on the lives of bees, and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested.

Although, I do not consider it a masterpiece it is very, very likable

I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say that it is one of my favorite books.  The imagry that Kidd uses is amazing.  I could place myself on that peach orchard in georgia.  You fall right in love with the charicters.  This book made me laugh it made me cry and feel outraged, and in love.  It is such a dynamic story with suspense.  I felt like i missed the charicters when i finnished the book, and i wish there were a sequal. I would reccomend this book to anyone

This book really great. I enjoyed the story immensley. Character development was excellent and descriptions in this story were fully visualized. I really could picture myself at the "flamingo pink" house in Tiburon. The main character, Lily is the sweetest kid anyone could ever come across, but with the anxieties of being a teenager and trying to find herself by finding out about her deceased mother. The group of sisters that she settles with teach her about life, love, faith and understanding. It's very heartfelt

One of the best books ever!!!!  I was disappointed that the story wasn't longer, as I was so sorry when it was over.  I even contemplated rereading it immediately, but decided to try another Sue Monk Kidd novel instead, and read The Mermaid Chair.  Different genre, but also very entertaining!  I have become an overnight, true fan of this author

Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.

When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).

On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.

Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.

While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.

A very good read

The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era.  It was wonderfully told and beautifully written.

The Messenger by Daniel Silva is just as interesting, exciting, and intriguing as every other Gabriel Allon book
has been.  I was hooked on page one and had a hard time putting it down until I reached the last page. My only regret is
that more of the story is not set in Venice, my favorite city. There is just enough of a parallel to characters and events in the real world to make the stories
plausible and just enough romance and action to make it gripping and absorbing. I am already looking forward to the next Gabriel Allon story
