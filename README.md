# NLP Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Overview

The **NLP Sentiment Analysis Project** is a comprehensive study aimed at building a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of textual data. This project utilizes natural language processing techniques and deep learning methods to analyze the sentiment of customer reviews.

## Objectives

- To preprocess textual data by cleaning and tokenizing.
- To build a sentiment analysis model using LSTM networks.
- To evaluate the model's performance and optimize it for better accuracy.
- To deploy the model for real-time sentiment analysis.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project consists of customer reviews. The reviews are labeled as either positive or negative. The data is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Cleaning**: Remove punctuation, special characters, and stopwords.
2. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
3. **Padding**: Ensure all sequences are of the same length by adding padding.
4. **Vocabulary Building**: Create a dictionary of all unique words in the dataset.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a sequential LSTM network with the following layers:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures the temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Dropout Layer**: Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping units.
- **Dense Layer**: Outputs the final prediction.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The performance is evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics. The model is also tested for generalization on unseen data.

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed using Flask for real-time sentiment analysis. The application takes user input, processes it, and returns the sentiment prediction.

## Conclusion

The **NLP Sentiment Analysis Project** demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning models in understanding and predicting the sentiment of textual data. The project also highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing and model tuning in achieving high accuracy.
